# The-Worm-Game


Welcome to the **Worm Game**, a simple and fun game inspired by the classic snake game, but with a worm! Control the worm, eat food to grow, avoid bombs, and see how long you can last!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click on the **Start Game** button to begin.
2. **Control the Worm**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the worm's movement:
   - Up Arrow: Move Up
   - Down Arrow: Move Down
   - Left Arrow: Move Left
   - Right Arrow: Move Right
3. **Eat Food**: When the worm eats food, it grows longer, and new food and bombs will appear.
4. **Avoid Bombs**: If the worm collides with a bomb, the game will end, and you will see a **Game Over** message.
5. **Worm Growth**: The worm will grow in length as it eats food. The longer the worm gets, the faster the game becomes.
6. **Message**: If the worm grows too long (over 10 segments), a message will appear.
7. **Restart**: After the game ends, you can click the **Restart Game** button to play again.

## Game Features

- **Dynamic Speed**: The worm starts slow but gradually becomes faster as it eats more food.
- **Bombs**: Watch out for bombs. If the worm touches one, it's game over!
- **Wrap Around**: The worm can wrap around the edges of the screen.
